            <p className="text-black/75 dark:text-white/75">
              I started my journey as a designer by designing websites and
              mobile apps. I began coding for fun, but soon fell in love with
              it. Since then, I have enjoyed converting my designs into reality.
            </p>
            <p className="text-black/75 dark:text-white/75">
              I started on the web in 2018. I had just left my job and wanted to
              start an online clothing brand. I needed a website but didn&#39;t
              have the budget for it. After receiving exorbitant offers from
              several companies I realized I was going to have to do my website
              on my own. At that time, I didn&#39;t know about Webflow so I
              started to learn how to code in HTML, CSS and javascript. A few
              months later, my website was coming to life.
